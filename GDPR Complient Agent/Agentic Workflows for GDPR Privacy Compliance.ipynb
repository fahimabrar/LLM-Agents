    "# Agentic Workflows for GDPR Privacy Compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project automates the creation of GDPR-compliant privacy policies using Large Language Models (LLMs). It includes a feedback loop between a policy generator and a compliance evaluator to iteratively improve the policy until it meets GDPR standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Simple Flowchart Infographic Graph.png\" alt=\"Flowchart\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Generation:**\n",
    "An LLM generates a privacy policy for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GDPR Compliance Check:**\n",
    "A more powerful evaluator LLM checks the generated policy for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggestion and Drafting:**\n",
    "If the policy is not GDPR-compliant, the evaluator LLM suggests improvements and saves both the current policy and suggestions as a draft in a CSV file using a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Refinement:**\n",
    "The suggestions are sent back to the policy generator LLM, which attempts to revise the policy accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterative Review:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the revised policy still does not pass the compliance check, the evaluator LLM continues to provide feedback and saves additional drafts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This process repeats until the policy meets GDPR compliance standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finalization:**\n",
    "Once the policy passes the compliance check, it is finalized and saved as a PDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "**How to structure LLM responses using specific data types**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to make LLMs interact with external tools and functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to build an iterative feedback loop between multiple LLMs for automated text generation and validation**"
