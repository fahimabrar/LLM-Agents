# LLM-Agents

Welcome to LLM-Agents â€“ a personal repository where I explore, build, and experiment with AI Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
This repo is dedicated to documenting my learning journey, sharing insights, and developing projects related to autonomous and semi-autonomous AI agents. Expect code samples, mini-projects, and experiments as I dive deeper into the world of AI agents and their real-world applications.

## 1. GDPR compliant Agent
**Overview**: This project automates the creation of GDPR-compliant privacy policies using Large Language Models (LLMs). It includes a feedback loop between a policy generator and a compliance evaluator to iteratively improve the policy until it meets GDPR standards.
